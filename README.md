#GitHub201 Project

## Always go back to git checkout main after looking around in the history.

## Issues are essentially a way to flag things to the repo maintainers/owners that may need to be updated.

## Branches are a great way to test a new path without changing the main branch which may be in production.

## Pull requests - a request to ask the main owner/administrator to merge new work (either from a separate repository or a branch) with the main branch.
